The idea was to develope a meta-language that describes the settings.
And then write a parser that parses the settings files and returns the correct Pipeline, Capturer, Filters and Persister.

Check out the example.txt of what I had in mind. Just ideas.

The different filters have different settings, you'll get the idea by looking at our code/uml already.
